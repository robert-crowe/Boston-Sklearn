# Udacity-Boston

v1.0 March 2016 - Robert Crowe

This is a fairly simple example of a regression problem, which was an early assignment in
the Udacity Machine Learning Engineering Nanodegree program.  It uses the Boston
Housing Prices dataset, which is included in Scikit-Learn, and a decision tree regressor.
It's implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
